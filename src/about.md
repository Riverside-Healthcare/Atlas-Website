# About

Atlas was originally created by the Riverside Healthcare Analytics team. In mid 2020 Riverside open sourced the project to allow other hospitals to take advantage of solution. Alternatives were pricey and we love collaboration. By open sourcing and working with other institutions we are able to together make something that alone we could not produce.
