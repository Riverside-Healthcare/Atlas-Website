# Access Control

<p class="subtitle pb-5">Secure your documentation.</p>

Atlas Library relies on the security from your source reporting systems to define who has access to reporting content. Most of the features inside of Atlas Library can be turned on/off for different user groups in access control.

## Adding Roles

A new install will have a handful of groups. We suggest adding more roles as needed on the `Role Privileges` tab. From this tab you can create roles, and then assign the role various security points.

## Adding Users to Roles

From the `User Roles` tab you can add users to specific groups to give them access to features.

## Director Role

The `Director` role is a key role in the `Request Access` tool. Users with the director role will be listed in the drop down. Users are required to choose a director before requesting access.
