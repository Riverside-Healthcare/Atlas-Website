## Collection Profile

All collections will have a `profile` included. In the profile you will find all the linked reports run data combined, who runs the reports. This is useful to find the general impact of concepts in your organization.

## Starring Collections

Starring a collection will add it to your home screen favorites.

## Sharing Collections

Collections can be shard directly in the app. The person receiving the share will receive a notification in the right sidebar, and also in the mail. SFTP can also be configured in the application settings to send notification to users email box.

## Giving Feedback

Users have the option to give feedback on collections. These option integrates with the `Manage Engine` ticketing system.
