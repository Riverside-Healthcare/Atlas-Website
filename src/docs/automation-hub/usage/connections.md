# Connections

The connection manager stores credentials for FTP, SFTP, SMB, SSH, Database and GPG encryption keys.

Connections are saved in organization groups which can also store contact information for the organization.

A connection group can have any number of different connections.

Password/ssh key/gpg key fields are all encrypted before being saved into the database.
