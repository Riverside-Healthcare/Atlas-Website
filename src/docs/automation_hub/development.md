# Development

Atlas Hub is developed using python and a few helpful tools:

## Primary Tools

:::content
- `Pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ for managing python environments
- `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`_ for managing dependencies
- `Precommit <https://pre-commit.com>`_  for reformating code before committing
- `Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_  running tests, verifying code
:::

## Precommit Setup

To setup precommit hooks:

``` bash
precommit install
```

Tests can be run with tox:

``` bash
